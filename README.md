# qtilerugo
qtile with rust compositor and go backend

Step-by-Step Project Outline
Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment

Goal: Install all necessary dependencies and set up the basic development environment.

Tasks:

    Install Python (Qtile dependencies):
        Install Python (3.8 or higher).
        Install Qtile dependencies: sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 libxcb1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-icccm4.
        Install Qtile: pip install qtile.

    Install Rust (for the compositor):
        Install Rust: Follow the installation guide at rust-lang.org.
        Install Cargo (Rust’s package manager).
        Install Vulkan SDK for Rust: cargo install vulkano (or use ash crate for Vulkan).

    Install Go (for background tasks):
        Install Go: Follow the installation guide at golang.org.

    Install dependencies for background tools (lxpolkit, Flameshot, etc.):
        Install lxpolkit for elevation: sudo apt install lxpolkit.
        Install Flameshot for screenshots: sudo apt install flameshot.

    Set up version control:
        Initialize a Git repository: git init.
        Commit the project structure regularly as you progress.

Step 2: Create the Rust Vulkan Compositor

Goal: Build a basic Rust-based compositor using Vulkan for GPU rendering.

Tasks:

    Create a new Rust project:
        Create a new Rust project: cargo new compositor.
        Set up Cargo.toml to include Vulkan dependencies such as ash or vulkan.

    Set up Vulkan in Rust:
        Use a crate like ash or vulkan to interface with Vulkan in Rust.
        Create a basic Vulkan pipeline that can render to a window.
        Handle basic rendering tasks such as displaying simple colored primitives or textures.

    Set up multi-threading in Rust:
        Utilize Rust’s async/await or std::thread for multi-threading.
        Use multiple threads to handle different parts of the compositing process (e.g., one thread for rendering, another for input handling).

    Testing and Debugging:
        Ensure that Vulkan is rendering properly.
        Test multi-threading to ensure no blocking in rendering or input handling.

Step 3: Integrate Rust Compositor with Qtile

Goal: Integrate the Rust compositor with Qtile for managing windows.

Tasks:

    Set up IPC (Inter-Process Communication):
        Use sockets, shared memory, or a simple IPC library to allow Qtile (Python) to communicate with the Rust compositor.
        Define a protocol to send window state changes (focus, move, etc.) from Qtile to Rust.

    Create Qtile configuration for the compositor:
        Modify Qtile’s configuration to start the Rust compositor as an external process.
        Use Qtile's Python hooks to send window state changes (e.g., focus or layout changes) to the compositor via IPC.

    Start the Rust compositor from Qtile:
        Ensure that Qtile starts and communicates with the compositor on startup.
        Test window management functionality (e.g., moving and focusing windows).

    Debug and ensure communication works smoothly.

Step 4: Create Go Back-End for Background Tasks

Goal: Build Go services to handle lxpolkit, Flameshot, and future remote desktop functionality.

Tasks:

    Set up Go project for background tasks:
        Create a Go project for managing background tasks: go mod init background.

    Implement lxpolkit in Go for elevation events:
        Use Go’s os/exec package to spawn and manage the lxpolkit process.
        Ensure that lxpolkit can be triggered for tasks requiring root access.

    Implement Flameshot in Go:
        Use Go to launch and control Flameshot in the background.
        Handle triggering of Flameshot for screenshots without interrupting the compositor.

    Set up Remote Desktop (future feature):
        Use Go to implement networking features needed for remote desktop (e.g., VNC, RDP).
        Implement basic screen sharing and input redirection.

    Ensure Go services are lightweight and non-blocking.

Step 5: Integrate Go Back-End with Qtile

Goal: Integrate the Go back-end (lxpolkit, Flameshot, remote desktop) with Qtile.

Tasks:

    Set up IPC between Go and Qtile:
        Use IPC (e.g., sockets or shared memory) to allow Qtile to communicate with Go.
        Trigger lxpolkit or Flameshot from Qtile when needed (e.g., when a screenshot is requested).

    Ensure background tasks run concurrently:
        Use Go goroutines to handle concurrent background tasks like lxpolkit, Flameshot, and remote desktop services.

    Test that background tasks are properly invoked from Qtile.

Step 6: Configure and Optimize Qtile

Goal: Fully configure Qtile and optimize performance for low-latency and multi-threading.

Tasks:

    Optimize Qtile configuration:
        Configure window layouts, keybindings, and workspace management in Qtile.
        Fine-tune Qtile’s Python configuration to communicate efficiently with the Rust compositor and Go back-end.

    Multi-threading and Performance Optimization:
        Ensure that Qtile and Rust compositor are running in separate threads without blocking each other.
        Use CPU pinning or core affinity to assign specific threads to certain cores for load balancing.
        Optimize Rust’s Vulkan rendering to take full advantage of the GPU and multi-core CPU setup.

    Testing and Profiling:
        Test the system with multiple windows, gaming, and other heavy workloads to ensure low-latency performance.
        Profile the system and address any bottlenecks in CPU or GPU usage.

    Optimize Go tasks to run concurrently without blocking the compositor or Qtile (use goroutines effectively).

Step 7: Final Testing and Debugging

Goal: Ensure that everything works smoothly and reliably.

Tasks:

    Stress testing: Test the full system with multiple monitors, games, and applications to ensure performance.
    Monitor resource usage: Ensure that the system efficiently uses CPU, GPU, and RAM with multiple threads and tasks.
    Check reliability: Verify that all components (Rust compositor, Qtile, Go background tasks) work in sync without crashes or      performance degradation.
    Fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.

Step 8: Packaging and Deployment

Goal: Package the system for installation and distribution.

Tasks:

    Package the components into a single cohesive installation system (e.g., create a .deb or .tar.gz package for easy           deployment).
    Documentation: Write installation instructions, usage guides, and configuration documentation for the system.
    Final Checks: Perform a final round of testing to ensure everything works after packaging.
