qtilerugo

qtilerugo is an integrated window management ecosystem for Qtile. It combines three custom components to extend your desktop environment on X11:

    xcb_wm_bridge: A Rust-based command bridge that interacts with the X server using x11rb and executes window management commands from a configurable TOML file.
    Rust Renderer: A custom Vulkan-based window renderer written in Rust using vulkano and winit that spawns custom-rendered windows or external applications.
    GoBar: A Go-based taskbar and system tray built with Fyne that displays system stats, provides a start menu, and integrates with X11 (using xgb).

Features

    Unified Command Interface:
    Send JSON-encoded commands over Unix sockets to control window management actions.

    Customizable and Modular:
    Each component (bridge, renderer, and taskbar) is self-contained and can be developed or replaced independently while integrating seamlessly.

    Advanced Rendering Capabilities:
    Leverage Vulkan via the Rust renderer for custom windows and dynamic interfaces.

    Integration with Qtile:
    Easily bind keys in your Qtile configuration to send commands to qtilerugo, extending Qtileâ€™s functionality.

Components Overview
xcb_wm_bridge

    Purpose:
    Acts as a command relay between Qtile and X11. It listens on a Unix socket (e.g., /tmp/x11rb_wm.sock) for JSON commands and executes corresponding window management actions (like focusing windows or spawning terminals).

    Configuration:
    Commands are mapped via a wm_config.toml file for easy customization.

Rust Renderer

    Purpose:
    Uses Vulkan to create custom-rendered windows. It listens on a Unix socket (e.g., /tmp/rust_qtile_helper.sock) for JSON commands such as SpawnWindow and SpawnStatusBar.

    Functionality:
    Spawns a Vulkan window or launches external applications (like the GoBar) based on incoming commands.

GoBar

    Purpose:
    A lightweight, customizable taskbar and system tray application written in Go.
    Features:
        Displays time, CPU usage, and network statistics.
        Provides a "Start Menu" by scanning installed .desktop files.
        Integrates with X11 by setting dock properties to reserve screen space.
        Uses systray functionality to add interactive tray icons for launching common applications.
